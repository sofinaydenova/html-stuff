<p align="middle"> Art is incredibly hard to define. The most popular thought on art is something which is made by a creative talented mind, expression of his/her feelings. <i> Something difficult and royal, which is sometimes hard to understand. Art should be educating, enlightening and empowering. It is made to forget about your shallow problems and daily routines. </i> </p>

<p align="middle"> <strong>On contrary, what is a game? </strong> </p>
<p align="middle"> Here is a general description: </p>

<p align="middle"> <q> A game is a system in which players engage in an artificial conflict, defined by rules, that results in a quantifiable outcome. (Salen & Zimmerman, 2004). </q></p>

<p align="middle"> Jesse Schell defines games as - </p>
<p align="middle"> <q> a problem-solving activity, approached with a playful attitude.</q></p>

<p align="middle">Sadly, there is nothing about art, aesthetic, perception, whatsoever. Only the combination of words <i>playful attitude</i> provides a hint that games can be made as an artistic intention. </p>
<p align="middle">Even Hideo Koijima said in one of his interviews: </p>
<p align="middle"> <q>Art is something that radiates the artist. If 100 people walk by and a single person is captivated by whatever that piece radiates, it is art. But video games are not trying capturing one person. A videogame should make sure that all 100 people that play that game should enjoy the service provided by that videogame. It is something of a service. It is not art. But I guess the way of providing service with that videogame is an artistic style, a form of art.</q> </p>
